# RED-Loss-Model

This is a repo storing RED-TCP loss Model research codes

Constructed by Qishen Sam Liang

For USC CSCI-651 by Prof. John Heidemann.

Part of the codes are generated by ChatGPT

# sender.c and receiver.c

Receiver should always be ran first, and then sender

Running make would build the executable

# mininet-setup.py

red limit is in **bytes**

bw is in MBps

# Command run

(you might also need to clear the remainer of the previous mininet)

```
sudo mn -c
```
To boot mininet in RED

```
sudo python3 RED-mininet-setup.py
```

Or Droptail

```
sudo python3 Droptail-mininet-setup.py
```

After booting mininet, in the mininet terminal run

```
xterm sender1
```

And in the extra terminal run

```
tcpdump -w sender8.pcap -tt
```

Going back to the mininet termial and run:

```
router python3 queue_monitor.py &
receiver ./receiver &
sender1 ./sender
```
